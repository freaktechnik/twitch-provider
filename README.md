# Twitch Chat Provider

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/freaktechnik/twitch-provider.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
Provides a twitch network type for Instantbird. Very much work in progress.

## Instantbird

See also issue #10 for stuff that needs to be changed in instantbird for this
extension to work.

## Thunderbird
The extension also works with Thunderbird, though the bugs needed for Instantbird
that affect the chat core are relevant there too.

Joining channels with many chatters isn't recommended in Thunderbird either, since
it rebuilds the whole participants and messages list whenever switching the room.
